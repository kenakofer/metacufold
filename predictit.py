- 10% fee on profits every time a market resolves (very bad)
- 5% fee on ALL withdrawls from PI, including principal (very bad)
- 1099-MISC provided by PI calculates income as profits minus their 10% fee
  on profits and minus their 5% fee to withdraw the profits, but DOES NOT
  subtract out the 5% for principal withdrawn.

For example:
- Start with $90 in your bank account
- Put it into PI
- Bet it all on 100 shares costing .90 each
- Win, with a profit of $10, before PI's cut
    - PI taken 10% or $1, leaving you with $9 profit on the platform.
- Your balance on PI now reads $99
- You withdraw everything, and PI takes 5%, about $5 in fees
- You have $94 in your bank account, a profit of 4.4%

Later on...
- Your 1099 will show an income of $10 - $1 - $0.50 = $8.50, because only the
fees on profits are subtracted. The 5% * $90 = 4.50 in principal withdrawl fees
is not subtracted, and if taxed at 25%, that false income will cost you another
$1.125 on tax day.
- The extra tax burden is close to principal * 5% * 25% == principal * 1.25%
- You can think of this as incurring a debt of 1.25% of any deposit, to be paid
  off after taxes after withdrawl of the principal. An easier way to think of it
  is as a higher withdrawl percentage of 6.25%, on the principal

Another example:
- Start with $100 in your bank account
- Put it into PI
- Bet it all on 1000 shares costing .10 each
- Win, with a profit of $900, before PI's cut
    - PI taken 10% or $90, leaving you with $810 profit on the platform.
- Your balance on PI now reads $910
- You withdraw everything, PI takes 5% = $45.5 in fees
- You have $864.5 in your bank account, a profit of 764.5%.

The effect of multiple bets:
- The winnings cut takes from the profits of every victory, but only cuts into
  the profit portion. Losses on other bets do not offset.
- The withdrawl cut is minimized if you use the deposit in PI for many bets
  in sequence. In other words, you may only need to make one large deposit for a
  lifetime of investments on the platform, especially if you can get it to grow.
- Additionally, lost bets offset the withdrawl cut
- Ditto for the extra tax burden, just minimize deposits.
- For the bulk of the 1099 tax burden, wins on PI will count against
  losses, so it's a tax on PI's net gains. However, wins/losses on
  PI can't be reported against wins/losses on other platforms.

((start / chance - start) * win_cut + start) * withdraw_cut - start

Let a Fee Adjusted Share Price (FASP) be the amount needed to deposit into the
market, purchase 1 Fee Adjusted Share (FAS), and, conditional on winning, obtain
1 dollar out.

Conservatively:
For PI, 1 share = .85 FAS
        1.176 shares = 1 FAS

Less conservatively, but still reasonable with many bets over a period of time:
For PI, 1 share = .875 FAS
        1.14 shares = 1 FAS
